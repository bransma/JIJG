/*
 * The main purpose of 1-pass quantization is to provide a fast, if not very
 * high quality, colormapped output capability.  A 2-pass quantizer usually
 * gives better visual quality; however, for quantized grayscale output this
 * quantizer is perfectly adequate.  Dithering is highly recommended with this
 * quantizer, though you can turn it off if you really want to.
 *
 * In 1-pass quantization the colormap must be chosen in advance of seeing the
 * image.  We use a map consisting of all combinations of Ncolors[i] color
 * values for the i'th component.  The Ncolors[] values are chosen so that
 * their product, the total number of colors, is no more than that requested.
 * (In most cases, the product will be somewhat less.)
 *
 * Since the colormap is orthogonal, the representative value for each color
 * component can be determined without considering the other components;
 * then these indexes can be combined into a colormap index by a standard
 * N-dimensional-array-subscript calculation.  Most of the arithmetic involved
 * can be precalculated and stored in the lookup table colorindex[].
 * colorindex[i][j] maps pixel value j in component i to the nearest
 * representative value (grid plane) for that component; this index is
 * multiplied by the array stride for component i, so that the
 * index of the colormap entry closest to a given pixel value is just
 *    sum( colorindex[component-number][pixel-component-value] )
 * Aside from being fast, this scheme allows for variable spacing between
 * representative values with no additional lookup cost.
 *
 * If gamma correction has been applied in color conversion, it might be wise
 * to adjust the color grid spacing so that the representative colors are
 * equidistant in linear space.  At this writing, gamma correction is not
 * implemented by jdcolor, so nothing is done here.
 */

/* Declarations for ordered dithering.
 *
 * We use a standard 16x16 ordered dither array.  The basic concept of ordered
 * dithering is described in many references, for instance Dale Schumacher's
 * chapter II.2 of Graphics Gems II (James Arvo, ed. Academic Press, 1991).
 * In place of Schumacher's comparisons against a "threshold" value, we add a
 * "dither" value to the input pixel and then round the result to the nearest
 * output value.  The dither value is equivalent to (0.5 - threshold) times
 * the distance between output values.  For ordered dithering, we assume that
 * the output colors are equally spaced; if not, results will probably be
 * worse, since the dither may be too much or too little at a given point.
 *
 * The normal calculation would be to form pixel value + dither, range-limit
 * this to 0..MAXJSAMPLE, and then index into the colorindex table as usual.
 * We can skip the separate range-limiting step by extending the colorindex
 * table in both directions.
