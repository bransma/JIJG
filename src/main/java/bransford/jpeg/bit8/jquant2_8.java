     * This module implements the well-known Heckbert paradigm for color
     * quantization.  Most of the ideas used here can be traced back to
     * Heckbert's seminal paper
     *   Heckbert, Paul.  "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display",
     *   Proc. SIGGRAPH '82, Computer Graphics v.16 #3 (July 1982), pp 297-304.
     *
     * In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the
     * usage count of each possible color.  To keep the histogram to a reasonable
     * size, we reduce the precision of the input; typical practice is to retain
     * 5 or 6 bits per color, so that 8 or 4 different input values are counted
     * in the same histogram cell.
     *
     * Next, the color-selection step begins with a box representing the whole
     * color space, and repeatedly splits the "largest" remaining box until we
     * have as many boxes as desired colors.  Then the mean color in each
     * remaining box becomes one of the possible output colors.
     *
     * The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output
     * color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
     * This mapping is logically trivial, but making it go fast enough requires
     * considerable care.
     *
     * Heckbert-style quantizers vary a good deal in their policies for choosing
     * the "largest" box and deciding where to cut it.  The particular policies
     * used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones
     * may yet be found.
     *
     * In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color
     * space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
     * This allowed the color conversion math to be done only once per colormap
     * entry, not once per pixel.  However, that optimization precluded other
     * useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling)
     * and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an
     * externally-supplied colormap.  We have therefore abandoned that approach.
     * The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
     *
     * To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled
     * RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than
     * B.  To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
     * The 2/3/1 scale factors used here correspond loosely to the relative
     * weights of the colors in the NTSC grayscale equation.
     * If you want to use this code to quantize a non-RGB color space, you'll
     * probably need to change these scale factors.

     * First we have the histogram data structure and routines for creating it.
     *
     * The number of bits of precision can be adjusted by changing these symbols.
     * We recommend keeping 6 bits for G and 5 each for R and B.
     * If you have plenty of memory and cycles, 6 bits all around gives marginally
     * better results; if you are short of memory, 5 bits all around will save
     * some space but degrade the results.
     * To maintain a fully accurate histogram, we'd need to allocate a "long"
     * (preferably unsigned long) for each cell.  In practice this is overkill;
     * we can get by with 16 bits per cell.  Few of the cell counts will overflow,
     * and clamping those that do overflow to the maximum value will give close-
     * enough results.  This reduces the recommended histogram size from 256Kb
     * to 128Kb, which is a useful savings on PC-class machines.
     * (In the second pass the histogram space is re-used for pixel mapping data;
     * in that capacity, each cell must be able to store zero to the number of
     * desired colors.  16 bits/cell is plenty for that too.)
     * Since the JPEG code is intended to run in small memory model on 80x86
     * machines, we can't just allocate the histogram in one chunk.  Instead
     * of a true 3-D array, we use a row of pointers to 2-D arrays.  Each
     * pointer corresponds to a C0 value (typically 2^5 = 32 pointers) and
     * each 2-D array has 2^6*2^5 = 2048 or 2^6*2^6 = 4096 entries.  Note that
     * on 80x86 machines, the pointer row is in near memory but the actual
     * arrays are in far memory (same arrangement as we use for image arrays).

     * These routines are concerned with the time-critical task of mapping input
     * colors to the nearest color in the selected colormap.
     *
     * We re-use the histogram space as an "inverse color map", essentially a
     * cache for the results of nearest-color searches.  All colors within a
     * histogram cell will be mapped to the same colormap entry, namely the one
     * closest to the cell's center.  This may not be quite the closest entry to
     * the actual input color, but it's almost as good.  A zero in the cache
     * indicates we haven't found the nearest color for that cell yet; the array
     * is cleared to zeroes before starting the mapping pass.  When we find the
     * nearest color for a cell, its colormap index plus one is recorded in the
     * cache for future use.  The pass2 scanning routines call fill_inverse_cmap
     * when they need to use an unfilled entry in the cache.
     *
     * Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally
     * sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance
     * calculation described by Spencer W. Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics
     * Gems II (James Arvo, ed.  Academic Press, 1991).  Thomas points out that
     * the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can
     * be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between
     * distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.  This allows a
     * fairly fast implementation of the "brute force" approach of computing the
     * distance from every colormap entry to every histogram cell.  Unfortunately,
     * it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram
     * cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
     * The work array elements have to be IJG_INT32s, so the work array would need
     * 256Kb at our recommended precision.  This is not feasible in DOS machines.
     *
     * To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the
     * nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
     * The work array need be only as big as the subbox, so the memory usage
     * problem is solved.  Furthermore, we need not fill subboxes that are never
     * referenced in pass2; many images use only part of the color gamut, so a
     * fair amount of work is saved.  An additional advantage of this
     * approach is that we can apply Heckbert's locality criterion to quickly
     * eliminate colormap entries that are far away from the subbox; typically
     * three-fourths of the colormap entries are rejected by Heckbert's criterion,
     * and we need not compute their distances to individual cells in the subbox.
     * The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too
     * small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion
     * can't eliminate as many colormap entries.  Empirically the best subbox
     * size seems to be about 1/512th of the histogram (1/8th in each direction).
     *
     * Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically
     * faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and
     * cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.  It is therefore not
     * useful for programs intended to be portable to DOS machines.  On machines
     * with plenty of memory, filling the whole histogram in one shot with Thomas'
     * refined method might be faster than the present code --- but then again,
     * it might not be any faster, and it's certainly more complicated.
